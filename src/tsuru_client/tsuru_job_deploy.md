## tsuru job deploy

Deploy the source code and/or configurations to a Job on Tsuru.

### Synopsis

Deploy the source code and/or configurations to a Job on Tsuru.

Files specified in the ".tsuruignore" file are skipped - similar to ".gitignore". It also honors ".dockerignore" file if deploying with container file (--dockerfile).

Examples:
  To deploy using a container image:
    $ tsuru job deploy -j <JOB> --image registry.example.com/my-company/my-job:v42

  To deploy using container file ("docker build" mode):
    Sending the the current directory as container build context - uses Dockerfile file as container image instructions:
      $ tsuru job deploy -j <JOB> --dockerfile .

    Sending a specific container file and specific directory as container build context:
      $ tsuru job deploy -j <JOB> --dockerfile ./Dockerfile.other ./other/


```
tsuru job deploy [--job <job name>] [--image <container image name>] [--dockerfile <container image file>] [--message <message>] [flags]
```
