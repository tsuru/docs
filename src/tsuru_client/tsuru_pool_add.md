## tsuru pool add

Adds a new pool.

### Synopsis

Adds a new pool.

Each docker node added using [[node-add]] command belongs to one pool.
Also, when creating a new application a pool must be chosen and this means
that all units of the created application will be spawned in nodes belonging
to the chosen pool.

```
tsuru pool add <pool> [-p/--public] [-d/--default] [--provisioner <name>] [-f/--force] [-l/--labels "{"key":"value"}"] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -d, --default              Make pool default (when none is specified during [[app-create]] this pool will be used)
  -f, --force                Force overwrite default pool
      --labels key=value     LabelSet that integrates with kubernetes, i.e could be used to define a podAffinity rule for the pool
      --provisioner string   Provisioner associated to the pool (empty for default docker provisioner)
  -p, --public               Make pool public (all teams can use it)
  -h, --help                 help for add
```
