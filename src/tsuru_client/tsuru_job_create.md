## tsuru job create

Creates a new job using the given name and platform

### Synopsis

Creates a new job using the given name and platform

In order to create an job, you need to be member of at least one team. All
teams that you are member (see [[tsuru team-list]]) will be able to access the
job

The [[--plan]] parameter defines the plan to be used. The plan specifies how
computational resources are allocated to your job execution. Typically this
means limits for cpu and memory usage is allocated.
The list of available plans can be found running [[tsuru plan list]]

If this parameter is not informed, tsuru will choose the plan with the
[[default]] flag set to true

The [[--schedule]] parameter defines how often this job will be executed. This string follows the unix-cron format,
if you need to test the cron expressions visit the site: https://crontab.guru/

The [[--team]] parameter describes which team is responsible for the created
app, this is only needed if the current user belongs to more than one team, in
which case this parameter will be mandatory

The [[--pool]] parameter defines which pool your app will be deployed.
This is only needed if you have more than one pool associated with your teams

The [[--description]] parameter sets a description for your job.
It is an optional parameter, and if its not set the job will only not have a
description associated

The [[--manual]] parameter sets your job as a manual job.
A manual job is only run when explicitly triggered by the user i.e: tsuru job trigger <job-name> 

The [[--tag]] parameter sets a tag to your job. You can set multiple [[--tag]] parameters

The [[--max-running-time]] sets maximum amount of time (in seconds) that the job
can run. If the job exceeds this limit, it will be automatically stopped. If
this parameter is not informed, default value is 3600s
