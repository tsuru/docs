## tsuru service instance bind

Binds an application or job to a previously created service instance. See [[tsuru

### Synopsis

Binds an application or job to a previously created service instance. See [[tsuru

environment variables to the application. All environment variables exported
by bind will be private (not accessible via [[tsuru env-get]]).

tsuru service instance bind <service-name> <service-instance-name> [-a/--app appname] [-j/--job jobname] [--no-restart] [flags]
```

  -a, --app string   The name of the app.
  -j, --job string   The name of the job.
      --no-restart   Binds an application to a service instance without restarting the application. Does not apply to jobs
  -h, --help         help for bind
```
