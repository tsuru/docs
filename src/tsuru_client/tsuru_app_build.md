## tsuru app build

Build a container image following the app deploy's workflow - but do not change anything on the running application on Tsuru.

### Synopsis

Build a container image following the app deploy's workflow - but do not change anything on the running application on Tsuru.
You can deploy this container image to the app later.

Files specified in the ".tsuruignore" file are skipped - similar to ".gitignore".

Examples:
  To build using app's platform build process (just sending source code or configurations):
    Uploading all files within the current directory
      $ tsuru app build -a <APP> .

    Uploading all files within a specific directory
      $ tsuru app build -a <APP> mysite/

    Uploading specific files
      $ tsuru app build -a <APP> ./myfile.jar ./Procfile

    Uploading specific files but ignoring their directory trees
      $ tsuru app build -a <APP> --files-only ./my-code/main.go ./tsuru_stuff/Procfile


```
tsuru app build [-a/--app <appname>] [-t/--tag <image_tag>] [-f/--files-only] <file-or-dir-1> [file-or-dir-2] ... [file-or-dir-n] [flags]
```

### Options

  -a, --app string   The name of the app.
  -f, --files-only   Enables single file build into the root of the app's tree
  -t, --tag string   The image tag
